Tailor, Soldier, Spy finds George Smiley, a recently retired MI6 agent,
doing his best to adjust to a life outside the secret service. However,
when a disgraced agent reappears with information concerning a mole at
the heart of the Circus, Smiley is drawn back into the murky field of
espionage.<br>
      <br>
Tasked with investigating which of his trusted former colleagues has
chosen to betray him and their country, Smiley narrows his search to
four suspects&#8212;all experienced, urbane, successful agents&#8212;but past
histories, rivalries and friendships make it far from easy to pinpoint
the man who is eating away at the heart of the British establishment.</span></small><br>

how much they have in common. The blurring of identity, the art of
disguise, the ability to become somebody else and to play that part
convincingly. Acting, so often said to be an investigation of &#8216;the
truth&#8217; is, like so much intelligence work, actually the concealment of
a lie.<br>
      <br>
Seated in his caravan on the set for the new film adaptation of John le
Carr&eacute;&#8217;s seminal Cold War thriller Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,
the actor Gary Oldman is talking about getting to grips with the role
of George Smiley, the master spy.<br>
      <br>
Smiley is one of the truly great creations of post-war English
literature: a nondescript man of late middle age who confounds every
stereotype of the spy as man of action; a man, as le Carr&eacute; has
it, with &#8216;a past so complex that he himself could not remember all the
enemies he might have made&#8217;, whose weapons are a beady eye and a
profound understanding of human fallibility. As Sherlock Holmes is to
the world of detection, so George Smiley is to the world of espionage.<br>
      <br>
Oldman is dressed for the part in a grey tweed three-piece suit, a
shirt and tie, and the horn-rimmed spectacles which, it seems, are the
key to incarnating the character of Smiley. &#8216;I tried on hundreds of
pairs,&#8217; he says, &#8216;and then you know in five seconds&#8230;&#8217; He pauses, in
search of the appropriate metaphor. &#8216;They are the Aston Martin.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
His manner is pensive, watchful, his movements contained. It is almost
as if he is wearing George Smiley. &#8216;This role is very much about
stillness,&#8217; he says. &#8216;There&#8217;s a point in the book where Smiley&#8217;s wife,
Ann, describes him as being like a swift, that he can lower his body
temperature till it&#8217;s the same as the environment, then he doesn&#8217;t lose
energy adjusting. Not to sound all methody, but it&#8217;s like my blood
pressure&#8217;s dropped. Maybe I&#8217;m the swift.&#8217; <br>
      <br>
Ostensibly based on le Carr&eacute;&#8217;s own experiences in the
intelligence services, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy was published in
1974, at a time when the Cold War was at its height, and the betrayals
of the so-called Cambridge Five</small></span></span><small

still fresh in the nation&#8217;s collective memory. The death of a British
agent on a botched operation in Czechoslovakia has led to suspicions
that a Soviet mole has penetrated the highest echelons of MI6. Smiley,
a senior officer who has been forced into retirement with the coming of
a new hierarchy, and who has &#8216;given himself full time to the profession
of forgetting&#8217;, is approached to surreptitiously root out the mole
among his erstwhile friends and associates. &#8216;It&#8217;s the oldest question
of all, George,&#8217; as Lacon, the senior civil servant who has brought
Smiley in out of the cold, puts it. &#8216;Who can spy on the spies?&#8217;<br>

Tinker, Tailor is a thriller almost devoid of action in the
conventional sense. What le Carr&eacute; describes is a cerebral chess
game in which the inner sanctum of &#8216;the Circus&#8217;, as he calls the Secret
Service, is a labyrinth of mirrors in which nobody is quite what they
seem, everybody&#8217;s motives are open to question and nobody can be
trusted. In modern spy stories, everybody hurries. Here, when Smiley
interrogates someone, time ticks away &#8216;without anyone using it&#8217;. He is
a man who &#8216;preferred to let the silence do its work, and he seemed
confident it would&#8217;. [...]<br>
      <br>
The idea of a film adaptation of Tinker, Tailor was first bruited by
the screenwriter Peter Morgan, best known for writing the films The
Deal, The Queen and Frost/Nixon. &#8216;He suggested, and we all agreed, that
doing a Cold War film 20 years after the Wall coming down was a great
idea,&#8217; Tim Bevan, the film&#8217;s producer, says. &#8216;And basing it on one of
the great literary pieces that depicted that seemed to be a very
sensible proposition.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Working closely with le Carr&eacute;, Morgan wrote a couple of drafts,
before pulling out to concentrate on other things. The script passed
into the hands of Peter Straughan and Bridget O&#8217;Connor, who more or
less started again from scratch. &#8216;The one thing Peter had proved to us
is that you could absolutely tell the story in 120 minutes,&#8217; Bevan says.<br>
      <br>
Bevan had talks with a number of British directors about the project,
but the formidable legacy of the BBC series and what he calls &#8216;the Alec
Guinness of it all&#8217; made them nervous. &#8216;I never saw that personally,&#8217;
he says. &#8216;I always just thought that this was a fantastic story, and if
it was made for television 30 years ago, so what?&#8217;<br>
      <br>
A solution presented itself in the person of Tomas Alfredson, the
Swedish director whose film Let the Right One In, a dark meditation on
the relationship between a troubled young boy and a vampire girl,
became an international success in 2008. &#8216;He came to see me,&#8217; Bevan
says, &#8216;and I was expecting some 20-year-old cool dude, and in wandered
Tomas, who is not a 20-year-old dude, but is a very cool and a very
interesting man.&#8217; [...]<br>
      <br>
What struck Alfredson then, he says</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>and
what continues to intrigue him now</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>is
the difference between the &#8216;ideal soldier&#8217; for the Cold War and for a
&#8216;hot&#8217; one. &#8216;It felt like the spy world was a very feminine world, even
though it was mostly men involved. It&#8217;s about feelings, intuition, the
ability to play around with the imagination</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>stuff
you really don&#8217;t need on the beaches of Normandy. Being a foreigner,
there&#8217;s a fascination for me about this former empire that still lives
with the idea that they are rulers of the world, and about the
endurance of the British &#8220;code&#8221; of behaviour and how these people
communicate with each other. For instance, in the last scene in the
film when Smiley has revealed the mole they still shake hands and
they&#8217;re very polite and Smiley says, &#8220;Anything I can help you with&#8230;&#8221;
And, of course, it&#8217;s a brilliant piece of literature,&#8217; he laughs, &#8216;and
totally impossible to put into a film, and that&#8217;s something that also
makes you want to do it.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
The production has taken over a disused Army barracks in north London,
a more economical option than renting studio space, and one that also
offers an infinite variety of usage. The old administrative block now
houses the film&#8217;s design studios and production offices (where a
photograph of Kim Philby is pinned on the door like some abiding patron
saint of betrayal). Corridors and alcoves have been used for interior
shots, and the side of a building has been &#8216;dressed&#8217; as the exterior of
a Wimpy bar.<br>
      <br>
In le Carr&eacute;&#8217;s book &#8216;the Circus&#8217; takes its name from Cambridge
Circus in London&#8217;s West End, where its headquarters are ostensibly
located. In the book, and in the TV adaptation, these premises were
depicted as cramped warrens of faded Edwardian gentility, with
muddy-green walls and scenes of England prints, pervaded by the smell
of &#8216;sweet dust and jasmine tea&#8217;. For the film, the production designer
Maria Djurkovic has re&shy;imagined the HQ as a 1970s block, secreted
within a complex of Edwardian buildings, and brought a period hi-tech
modernism to the interiors.<br>
      <br>
In one corner of a warehouse, a conference room has been constructed,
padded with sound-insulation foam; on a glass-topped table stands a
whisky decanter and an ashtray brimming with cigarette butts. There is
a large open-plan office where the admin staff and secretaries (&#8216;the
mothers&#8217;, as le Carr&eacute; had it) sit, rows of wooden desks with
ancient typewriters and empty wastepaper bins upturned on their surface
(in keeping with service protocol), and a single early-model Wang word
processor (the 1200 model, introduced in 1974). Authentic period
posters are pinned to the wall: remember</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>telephone
talk is not secure; what the hydrogen bomb does.<br>
      <br>
In another building, Alfredson has been filming a scene where Smiley
and his righthand man, Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), arrive at
the shabby terrace house where &#8216;the mole&#8217; conducts his clandestine
meetings with his Soviet contact. It is a short scene, merely showing
the two men entering the house; a moment of consternation from the
housekeeper, a dog leaping excitedly on to a sofa at the arrival of
strangers. &#8216;Be quiet, dog,&#8217; the housekeeper says. (Actually the dog is,
on command, being quiet. The barks will be overdubbed later.)<br>
      <br>
Bevan says, &#8216;You kind of know what the movie would have been like with
virtually any English director, and the fact is you didn&#8217;t with Tomas.
Oftentimes the best films about places are made by people who don&#8217;t
come from there. I remember Nic Roeg saying that the brilliant thing
about making Walkabout was that he didn&#8217;t know anything about
Australia, and the film was his journey of getting to know the country.
And I think for Tomas his journey in getting to know England through
making this movie is one the audience will take through the film as
well.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Alfredson has assembled a stellar cast of British actors, including
Colin Firth (who plays Bill Haydon, the suave, insouciant agent at the
heart of the conspiracy), Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and John Hurt. But
it was laying to rest what Alfredson calls &#8216;the Alec Guinness ghost&#8217;
that was to prove the most difficult challenge. &#8216;It was an almost
impossible problem to solve,&#8217; he says. &#8216;I think we sat nearly a year
without any ideas. We couldn&#8217;t go with someone almost like Alec Guinness</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>that
would not be fair to that actor, or to Sir Alec. So I felt we needed to
have another silhouette, another energy, another body, but yet George
Smiley.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Alfredson says he casts his films by envisaging his principal
characters as animals. &#8216;So this is a fox, this is a snake, this a frog</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>not
the image of a frog, but the soul of a frog. This way you are much
freer to choose from different ages and types.&#8217; Smiley, he says, is &#8216;a
turtle, because the turtle has so much of its body hidden inside a
shell; it is fixed, and it doesn&#8217;t have a lot of different expressions.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Gary Oldman, an actor for whom the adjective &#8216;kinetic&#8217; might have been
invented, does not seem the most obvious choice to fit this
description. Having made his early reputation as one of the outstanding
young English actors of his generation with films such as Sid and Nancy
and Prick Up Your Ears, in more recent years Oldman has been living in
Hollywood, playing villains and larger-than-life roles in &#8216;franchise&#8217;
films such as Batman and Harry Potter.<br>
      <br>
&#8216;He is a different type, and yet the same soul,&#8217; Alfredson says of
Oldman. &#8216;He has invested a whole career in order to get this face, this
voice, to get the experience to play&#8230; nothing</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>which
is the hardest thing you can ask an actor to do.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Oldman says he hesitated about stepping into the shoes of Guinness</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>&#8216;but
not for long. The chance to play a character that&#8217;s internal and quiet
was one that ultimately I couldn&#8217;t say no to. I&#8217;m in no way putting
myself in the same league, but you&#8217;ve got Guinness and you&#8217;ve got Gary,
and there&#8217;s 30 years or something between them, but there&#8217;s a road map
that we&#8217;re both following; and anyone with a modicum of talent or
instinct will walk that path.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
For Oldman, the most important signs on the map have come from le
Carr&eacute; (or to give him his proper name, David Cornwell) himself.
&#8216;You read the book, you read the script and then you meet David, and
his signature is in all those characters, but specifically it&#8217;s in
Smiley. And I&#8217;ve taken some things from him</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>a
few mannerisms, a certain inflection in the speech. It began as an
impersonation and I&#8217;ve worked it through my own filter. I suspect
Guinness took something from him, too.<br>
      <br>
&#8216;Smiley is someone who melts into the furniture. And sometimes you
don&#8217;t want anything at all to read in the eyes. There are times when he
looks almost bored</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>and
that&#8217;s when you know he&#8217;s interested. So it&#8217;s been a great joy in that
sense, and challenging, because so much of it is internal.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Oldman says that Tinker, Tailor is the kind of thoughtful, intelligent,
well-crafted film that comes along all too rarely. &#8216;It&#8217;s an
intellectual thriller. And I was amazed at the script. It&#8217;s very
refreshing that it&#8217;s as faithful as it can be to the book given that we
have two hours to tell it rather than six hours.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
&#8216;You need to choose what to put the magnifying glass on,&#8217; Alfredson
explains. &#8216;This story is about betrayal, in a very private way, between
friends and people you&#8217;re supposed to trust. So we have done a film
that&#8217;s extremely close to the characters, and much less about the Cold
War or the politics.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
In Alfredson&#8217;s film the sense of intrigue and emotional tension</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>and
of time ticking away without anyone using it</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>is
stretched as tight as a piano wire. &#8216;It&#8217;s a tricky thing, this,&#8217; he
says with a slight smile. &#8216;It&#8217;s one thing to depict boredom, but what
you don&#8217;t want is to be boring.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
The sense of period is superbly evoked</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>a
pre-digital world of telephone boxes, clunking great tape-recorders, of
rain, austerity and gloom. &#8216;The gloom is important,&#8217; Alfredson says.
&#8216;But it&#8217;s a nice gloom, for some reason. That was a very strong memory
for me of coming here for the first time in 1973. If you see London now
and at that time, it&#8217;s two different cities. Today it&#8217;s a white city,
then it was black; it was so dirty, and you could still feel the war
all around. And I think we&#8217;ve captured that.&#8217; Bevan describes Tinker,
Tailor as feeling &#8216;like a film that was made in the 1970s, rather than
a film about the 1970s&#8217;, the stylistic equivalent to such classic films
of the period as Coppola&#8217;s The Conversation and Bertolucci&#8217;s The
Conformist.<br>
      <br>
Le Carr&eacute;, who is credited as an executive producer on the film,
has played an almost oracular role in its making. All of the principal
actors have sat down with him at one time or another, picking his
brains about service procedure, slang, the pressures of living in a
constant state of anxiety. &#8216;Waiting for the noise of the shoes on the
stairs,&#8217; Oldman says. &#8216;David talked about that. It&#8217;s one of the things
he remembers very vividly. The fear of their cover being blown.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Cumberbatch, who plays Guillam, the young officer who aids Smiley in
tracking down the mole, describes his meeting with le Carr&eacute; as
&#8216;priceless. He has a very full vision of that world and the history of
the character, so it&#8217;s all there on a plate for you after having a
conversation with him.&#8217; In preparation, Cumberbatch had taken himself
off, alone, to the Moroccan seaside town of Essaouira. Le Carr&eacute;
makes mention in the book of Guillam having been stationed in Morocco,
and Essaouira, with its maze of narrow streets, its long shadows, its
window shutters banging in the wind blowing off the Atlantic, provided
a perfect setting for the cultivation of feelings of unease. &#8216;It&#8217;s got
a slightly nightmare quality,&#8217; Cumberbatch says, &#8216;and I was wandering
around the streets at night, thinking what it must be like to know that
every turn could be my last. It was very helpful.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
For Alfredson it was le Carr&eacute;&#8217;s benediction that finally
assuaged his early concerns about whether to make the film at all. &#8216;He
said, please don&#8217;t do the book and please don&#8217;t do the TV series; they
already exist. And the man is like a living encyclopaedia</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>and
so friendly, interested, updated; he&#8217;s one of the youngest people I&#8217;ve
ever met, although he&#8217;s 80 this year. Just a fantastic person.&#8217;
Alfredson recalls one occasion when he was shooting a particularly
critical scene in the film where the inner circle of the Circus are
gathered around the conference table. &#8216;When we rehearsed it, it felt as
if Bill Haydon should say something, but what would he say? Well, why
not call John le Carr&eacute; and see if he&#8217;s in? And we called him and
we described the situation. He thought for 15 seconds and he said, grab
a pen, here it is. It was a fantastic moment.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="http://www.firth.com/images/ttss/pub036m.jpg"
 style="width: 449px; height: 300px;" align="right" hspace="6"
 vspace="3">&#8216;I almost expected it to be brought in on a velvet
cushion,&#8217; Colin Firth, who plays Haydon, says. He laughs. &#8216;Your line&#8230;
fresh from the maestro.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Firth says he has closely modelled his depiction of Haydon on Kim
Philby (whom le Carr&eacute; once described as &#8216;spiteful, vain and
murderous&#8217;). &#8216;Le Carr&eacute; doesn&#8217;t say that Philby was the
inspiration for Haydon, but I&#8217;ve decided to tie him to Philby.&#8217; With
Alfredson, Firth studied newsreel footage of Philby&#8217;s infamous 1955
press conference following the defection of Burgess and Maclean, in
which Philby denied he was &#8216;the third man&#8217;</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>seven
years before he fled to Moscow. &#8216;You can see the tremendous tension in
his body language and in his facial expression, but he cannot hide the
sense of mischief. The image of the Russian doll-within-a-doll that
Smiley applies to Haydon comes to mind when you look at someone like
Philby, because you don&#8217;t ever quite get to the bottom of his
motivation.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
One of the intriguing things about Tinker, Tailor, Firth says, is that
it takes place against the background of the Empire&#8217;s decline, and the
clash of ideologies which</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>a
mere 40 years on</small></span></span><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><span
 style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><small>already
seems curiously like ancient history. &#8216;One can be almost nostalgic
about the Cold War now. The idea of it being so complicated, but
somehow ideologically seeming so simple, particularly as we look at the
West now and question whether capitalism really did win that struggle.
The last rites were pronounced on Eastern European communism, but we&#8217;ve
yet to see who was really the biggest loser.<br>
      <br>
&#8216;John le Carr&eacute; has been attacked for just writing for men and
being &#8220;completely unemotional&#8221;,&#8217; Firth goes on, &#8216;but looking at this
story now I think it&#8217;s profoundly emotional; the sense of melancholy is
huge. David has described Smiley as the ultimate disappointed romantic,
and one of the things the film picks up very strongly is that he wants
to believe in these incredibly simple, and arguably rather sentimental,
values, and yet he&#8217;s constantly disappointed.&#8217; [...]<br>
      <br>
      </small></span></span><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><span
 style="font-family: verdana;"><small>The call has come for Oldman to
be on set. For a moment he sits quite still, as if summoning the spirit
of Smiley. It&#8217;s odd, he says at last, how over the last few months he
has found himself becoming more watchful, more introspective. &#8216;Not so
chatty&#8230; My wife said to me the other day, &#8220;Are you listening to what
I&#8217;m saying? I&#8217;ve been talking to you for about an hour? Are you going
to engage?&#8221; Because I think I was sort of drifting away.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
He adjusts his glasses, and rises from his seat. &#8216;I think I&#8217;ll miss him
when this ends.&#8217; <br>

was riveted when I watched Tinker, Tailor on television in the
Seventies. That led me to read some of le Carr&eacute;&#8217;s other books,
like The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. I found putting the pieces
together was exciting. I found the characters incredibly vivid.</span><br

      <br style="font-family: verdana;">
      <span style="font-family: verdana;">&#8216;The thing that keeps coming
up in book after book is how lonely these characters are. I don&#8217;t want
to sound too airy-fairy when I talk about the book, but that urban
melancholy and isolation in a very sophisticated, rather merciless
world is, I think, the thing that actually hits the spot with readers.</span><br

 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Gary Oldman on playing
George Smiley, the world-weary British spy</span><br
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
When Gary Oldman learned that he would be playing world-weary British
spy George Smiley, he knew the best research would be to ask a real spy
what the Cold War was like. The man he asked spent six years, from 1958
to 1964, tapping phone lines, stealing information and running secret
agents for both MI5 and MI6. He was David Cornwell, better known as
John le Carr&eacute;.<br>
      <br>
&#8216;Britain has always had spies and I think we&#8217;ve spied rather well,&#8217;
says Oldman, 53. &#8216;But we have a rather romantic view of it and le
Carr&eacute; was the first to really show the reality.<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="http://www.firth.com/images/ttss/dm01go.jpg"
 style="width: 253px; height: 350px;" align="right" hspace="5">&#8216;He told
me that you would be given an assignment and go to Russia or to
Czechoslovakia. You would be sent to watch someone. You would be in
some miserable little room with a fake ID, and it would be very lonely
and often very boring. He said that the terror of having your cover
blown was exhausting: you were always waiting for the footsteps on the
stairs. I guess that&#8217;s why so many of them hit the bottle.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Oldman was once a destructively heavy drinker himself and, like Smiley,
has a rocky marital history. The intensity he brings to the role of
Smiley might surprise anyone more used to the cool, calm Alec Guinness
in the Seventies TV adaptation.<br>
      <br>
We meet twice. The first time on set in north London. Oldman is dressed
in an old-fashioned pair of grey striped pyjamas, waiting to do a scene
where Smiley gets a late-night visit. The first thing he wants to show
me is Smiley&#8217;s glasses</small><small style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><small>for
which he tried and rejected more than 100 pairs. &#8216;For me, Smiley&#8217;s
glasses are as iconic as the Aston Martin in the James Bond films, so I
had to get them right,&#8217; he says. &#8216;The book refers to Smiley cleaning
his glasses on his tie. Having met him, I get the feeling that comes
directly from le Carr&eacute;. I sense that Smiley is very personal to
him, that it&#8217;s somewhat autobiographical.&#8217; Oldman says he even uses le
Carr&eacute;&#8217;s voice when playing Smiley. &#8216;But I never told him.&#8217; [...]<br>
      <br>
&#8216;When le Carr&eacute; was writing this story there was a sort of rather
quaint English way of thinking: &#8220;Oh no</small><small
 style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><small>an Old Etonian
couldn&#8217;t possibly be a traitor.&#8221; The idea that deception and betrayal
could completely turn the British intelligence service inside out was a
novelty then. Not so much today....<br>
      <br>
&#8216;</small><small>We have a yearning for that time. Political correctness
has become a straightjacket. It&#8217;s refreshing to watch people drinking
and smoking and using phone boxes! Tinker, Tailor also has that feel. I
want to be in that world.<br>
      <br>
&#8216;The real le Carr&eacute; junkies might feel it&#8217;s not the full meal,
but I think it works very well. At first I lamented the loss of a lot
of MI6 jargon</small><small style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">&#8212;</small><small>lamplighters
(surveillance experts) and ferrets (technicians). But I think in a
two-hour film it would have been confusing to some people. It&#8217;s a less
cosy, English affair. It&#8217;s a little sexier, more contemporary, less
nostalgic than the TV series; crueller. It&#8217;s still set in the Cold War
period, but it has an edge.&#8217;<br>
      <br>
Has le Carr&eacute; seen it?<br>
      <br>
&#8216;I spoke to him on the phone after he&#8217;d watched the film. He loved it.
As he so eloquently put it, &#8220;We&#8217;ve turned the cow into an Oxo cube.&#8221;
And I think we&#8217;ve done it very well.&#8217;<br>

talks about laying Alec Guinness's ghost to rest in new film</big></big><br>
(Daily Mail, Nov 5, 2010, by Baz Bamigboye)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
Gary Oldman drinks a mug of builder's tea and talks about the art of
becoming ace spy-catcher George Smiley&#8212;and of laying the ghost of Alec
Guinness to rest.<br>
      <br>
It took Oldman two months before he felt able to sign on to play
quietly ruthless intelligence officer Smiley, created in literary form
by John le Carre and on the small screen by Alec Guinness in the BBC
television drama Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy in 1979.<br>
      <br>
      <img alt=""
 src="http://www.firth.com/images/ttss/dm_110510_smiley.jpg"
 style="width: 233px; height: 423px;" align="right" hspace="6">'I
always say "Why me?" on every role,' Oldman confessed as we sat in his
trailer on the set of the first big-screen version of Tinker, while
celebrated director Tomas Alfredson (who made acclaimed psychological
thriller Let the Right One In) and his crew set up the next shot.
'Then, of course, there's the ghost of Alec Guinness. It was
beautifully acted and a very well done television series 30 years ago.
So did I worry about that?<br>
      <br>
'Initially, I was worried. I remember watching it at the time, and
rewatched it. Always been a fan of Guinness.<br>
      <br>
But this was never going to be a carbon copy.' Producer Tim Bevan of
Working Title Films, who is producing the film with Robyn Slovo, said
he got the sense from Oldman that the actor had decided: 'I'm not going
to let this (Guinness's version) be a Boogie Woogie on my shoulder.'<br>
      <br>
Oldman told me: 'I'm 52. let's say I'm playing 55. There have been many
Smileys, so he could be all things. I know in the book he's described
as a short fat man, but he can be Denholm Elliott, he can be Alec
Guinness, he can be James Mason&#8212;and he can be Gary Oldman, I think.'<br>
      <br>
Preparing for the role, he took himself off to Old Focals, the vintage
eyewear store in Pasadena. 'Glasses are funny things. For Smiley,
they're iconic. It's like the Aston Martin or the Martini, shaken not
stirred. You try on hundreds of pairs over a period of hours and
suddenly you find what you're looking for.' He snapped up the authentic
Seventies black-rimmed tortoiseshell spectacles and had the Working
Title studio copy them.<br>
      <br>
He met Tinker's author David Cornwell&#8212;le Carr&eacute; is his
pseudonym&#8212;and found himself observing his mannerisms. 'The way he
touched his shirt, spoke and so on. I took all that and used it. I hope
he won't mind, but Smiley is in his DNA.'<br>
      <br>
The film will be based on a scorching screenplay by Bridget O'Connor
and Peter Straughan that is faithful to the book, but has a few
fabulous surprises of its own.<br>
      <br>
I mentioned that when I watched Oldman shoot scenes on Maria
Djurkovic's radical set (spacious and full of pod-like secret chambers)
with John Hurt, Colin Firth, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Toby Jones and David
Dencik, it was as if his Smiley had blended into the furniture. Oldman
said he tried to keep in mind a passage in the novel where Smiley's
errant wife, Lady Ann, describes how Smiley can lower his body
temperature and assume the environment of the room. 'He's
mild-mannered, quite methodical and perspicacious.'<br>
      <br>
Observing Alfredson, his cast and crew at work for several hours, I got
the sense that great work was being made at a disused barracks. Oldman
was clearly having the time of his life playing Smiley. 'I've come in
from the cold,' he laughed. 'No! I've come in to the cold, because I
live in Los Angeles and it's 80 degrees there.<br>
      <br>
'It's proper work, and I haven't done that for a long time,' he said.
'I've played some amazing roles and I've had a good run, but this is
something else. And it's like coming home. I can't remember the last
time I played an Englishman.'<br>
      <br>
The Tinker film also features Benedict Cumberbatch, Kathy Burke, Tom
Hardy, Stephen Graham and Laura Carmichael&#8212;who plays the vengeful
middle sister Lady Edith in Downton Abbey.<br>

Kathy Burke is coming in from the cold<br>
      </big><small>(Daily Mail, Oct 22, 2010, by Baz Bamigboye)<br>
      <br>
Kathy Burke has come in from the cold and returned to acting to play a
brilliant spy-catcher. The award-winning actress will appear in an
impressive ensemble led by Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy and
Benedict Cumberbatch in the big-screen version of John le
Carr&eacute;&#8217;s classic espionage novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.<br>
      <br>
In what she called a &#8216;blinding&#8217; part, Kathy has been on set since
Monday playing Connie Sachs, a former Soviet expert who had been forced
out of the Secret Intelligence Service, MI6&#8212;what le Carr&eacute; termed
&#8216;The Circus&#8217;&#8212;because she knew too much. Oldman, playing master spy
George Smiley, wants Connie&#8217;s knowledge of Soviet comings and goings in
London and Moscow to enable him to burrow through dusty operations and
flush out a Russian mole whose activities have paralysed the Service.<br>
      <br>
Burke retired from acting &shy;several years ago to concentrate on
&shy;writing and directing for stage and &shy;television. The move
stunned fans who had seen her &shy;playing Waynetta Slob and Perry the
vile teen on Harry Enfield shows on TV, or delivering a &shy;searing
portrait of a battered pregnant wife in Gary Oldman&#8217;s film Nil By
Mouth&#8212;a role which won her the best actress prize at the Cannes Film
Festival.<br>
      <br>
Connie is so wonderfully &shy;different from the kind of female one
finds in a Bond movie&#8212;which is appropriate, since le Carr&eacute;
always said his Smiley was the anti-James Bond. Blazers and slacks are
Connie&#8217;s uniform&#8212;not Bond-girl bikinis. She lives in an Oxford flat
with her grey spaniel Flush, her arthritic hands tackle the Times
crossword, she enjoys a bottle of sherry and privately teaches the
occasional student. Her mind is like a computer as she conjures up
distant memories and ancient secret files on Soviet dogsbodies for
Smiley.<br>
      <br>
Beryl Reid played the part to great acclaim in the 1979 BBC TV
adaptation, but the Connie in the movie version will be drawn from how
screenwriters Bridget O&#8217;Connor (who, sadly, died this week), Peter
Straughan and director Tomas Alfredson see her, and of course, Kathy&#8217;s
interpretation. &#8216;It will not be an impersonation of Beryl,&#8217; is how
Kathy put it.<br>
      <br>
Producers Tim Bevan, Eric &shy;Fellner and Robyn Slovo have been busy
putting the final touches to casting. John Hurt will be Control, le
Carr&eacute;&#8217;s name for the Circus chief, while Toby Jones will play
Percy Alleline. Jones takes over from Mad Men actor Jared Harris, who
had to bow out of Tinker, Tailor due to scheduling problems because
he&#8217;s playing Professor Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes 2 for Guy Ritchie,
which is also shooting on locations in London.<br>

      </big>(Screendaily, September 23, 2010, by Andreas Wiseman<br>
      <br>
Working Title today confirmed the cast for Tomas Alfredson&#8217;s adaptation
of John Le Carre novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, due to shoot at
the end of Sept.<br>
      <br>
Gary Oldman will play lead character George Smiley, with Benedict
Cumberbatch, David Dencik, Colin Firth, Stephen Graham, Tom Hardy,
Jared Harris, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Svetlana Khodchenkova, Roger Lloyd
Pack and Mark Strong, rounding out the cast.<br>
      <br>
The&#8217; 70s-set spy novel adaptation is written by Peter Straughan and
Bridget O&#8217;Connor and produced by Working Title&#8217;s co-chairmen Tim Bevan
and Eric Fellner and Robyn Slovo. Executive producers are Debra
Hayward, Liza Chasin, Douglas Urbanski, Peter Morgan and John Le Carre.<br>
      <br>
StudioCanal are funding Tinker, Tailor and will release the film first
in the UK through Optimum on Sept 16, 2011, and then in France and
Germany through Kinowelt. StudioCanal are handling international sales
for the rest of the world.<br>
      <br>
Filming will take place in London and on location in Budapest and
Istanbul.<br>
      <br>
Bevan said: &#8220;Tomas is one of the most gifted directors in the industry
and we are really looking forward to working with him on such
anexciting project. The timing is right for a big screen version of Le
Carre&#8217;s classic novel. It&#8217;s great for us to have Tomas onboard who has
assembled a stellar cast and will bring a unique vision to the
material.&#8221;<br>

      <big><big>Mark Strong Added To Tinker, Tailor</big></big><br>
(Empire, Sept 20, 2010. by James White)<br>
      <br>
As if the new adaptation of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy didn&#8217;t already
have one of the best ensemble casts to gather on one movie for along
time, yet another quality thesp has been added to the roster, in the
form of Mark Strong.<br>
      <br>
Empire's sources suggest that Strong will be playing Jim Prideaux, a
Circus agent shot in the back during the failed Operation Testify early
on in the story. Prideaux's testimony is a key part of the revelation
that there's a mole in the highest echelons of the British Secret
Service, with our hero George Smiley then spending the film trying to
smoke out the double agent.<br>
      <br>
...[H]is casting is just another reason we&#8217;re now seriously
anticipating the latest translation of John Le Carr&eacute;&#8217;s work to
the screen before a single frame has been committed to celluloid. But
when you have a cast that includes Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy,
Jared Harris, Benedict Cumberbatch (as Peter Guillam) and Ciaran Hinds,
all under the direction of Let The Right One In&#8217;s Thomas Alfredson, you
can understand our feelings. Even though, as The Playlist points outs,
Ralph Fiennes and David Thewlis aren&#8217;t mentioned. That just makes us
think they considered but passed&#8212;though the truth of that won&#8217;t be
known until the thing is actually filming.<br>
      <br>
And the female contingent has also increased by one (to, er, one
announced so far), with Svetlana Khodchenhova signing on to play
Russian spy Irina.<br>
      <br>
Reassuringly, producer Tim Bevan assures fans of the original that the
Cold War setting and the plot about Oldman&#8217;s George Smiley hunting for
a mole within the Secret Service will be maintained, largely at the
insistance of Le Carr&eacute; himself, who will be present on set to
provide information and probably cuff actors round the head if they
start acting like silly arses.<br>

producers take heed after John le Carr&eacute; warns tinker at your
peril</big></big><br>
(Daily Mail, Sept 17, 2010, by Baz Bamigboye)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
John le Carr&eacute; has decreed that the big-screen version of his
most famous novel, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, starring Gary Oldman and
Colin Firth, will remain in the Cold War era and not be updated in any
shape or form.<br>
      <br>
The new movie is now in pre-production and will begin filming soon. For
about five minutes, early on during the process of putting the film
together, there was talk of shifting the story, about master British
intelligence officer George Smiley's hunt for a mole within The Circus
(the secret service), from its Seventies timeline.<br>
      <br>
But le Carr&eacute; was adamant that it should remain rooted in the
Cold War. And screenwriter Peter Morgan has complied. Tim Bevan of
Working Title, who is producing the film, told me: 'The television
drama with Alec Guinness came out in the late Seventies, when we were
still ensnarled in the Cold War. Now the Cold War's gone, we have to
recreate it.' He added that le Carr&eacute; will be around during
filming, to keep an eye on things.<br>
      <br>
Firth, who was in Toronto for the world premiere of The King's Speech,
a movie that has emerged (as I predicted) as a leading contender for
Oscar and Bafta nominations, has one of the main parts in the gripping
spy tale, first published in 1974. He told me how Peter Morgan's
screenplay has pared le Carr&eacute;'s novel down.<br>
      <br>
'He's made it dialogue-free a lot of the time. It's quite masterful.
For instance, a tiny hand movement can signify something of great
importance, and the nuance in somebody's expression can mean something
major.'<br>
      <br>
Firth explained that he and the film's director, Tomas Alfredson, spoke
often about the texture of the piece and wanted to explore the human
element. <br>
      <br>
'What I love about le Carr&eacute; is that it's more about human
motivation than whodunit. The reason why somebody betrays their country
is personal and passionate.'<br>
      <br>
He added that looking back to the Seventies gave the movie a 'film
noir-ish' feel.<br>
      <br>
'It has the same sort of resonance that the Forties had, when viewed
from the Seventies. This really feels like a rainy, low-tech London.<br>
      <br>
'I'm not an expert on the intelligence game, but I know that there's
still a lot of low-tech employed because if you are a spy, you don't
want to be walking around with your data on a mobile phone or a
computer, because it's traceable and hackable. It's reality based, as
opposed to James Bond or Mission Impossible, and the thing is, we're
fascinated by the basic nuts and bolts of the tradecraft!'<br>
      <br>
To back up his case, he mentioned the recent spy-swap, and the story of
the analyst found dead in a holdall at a safe house in Pimlico.<br>
      <br>
The film also stars Tom Hardy, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch and
Svetlana Khodchenhova, who will play the role of Russian spy Irina.<br>
      <br>
Meanwhile, The King's Speech will have a special gala screening at the
BFI London Film Festival in October. Public bookings for tickets for
all films opens on September 27.<br>

      <br>
Ralph Fiennes, Colin Firth, Gary Oldman and Michael Fassbender will
star in the espionage thriller "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" for
Working Title and Studio Canal. Swedish helmer Tomas Alfredson ("Let
The Right One In") has already signed on to direct the pic, which will
begin lensing in October in London.<br>
      <br>
Based on John Le Carr&eacute;'s 1974 bestseller, story is set in the
aftermath of the Cold War and involves a spy hunt within the highest
echelons of the British Secret Intelligence Service. Le Carr&eacute;'s
novel also spawned a 1970s Brit TV series that starred Alec Guinness.<br>
      <br>
Peter Morgan ("Frost/Nixon") penned the adaptation. Tim Bevan and Eric
Fellner are producing. Debra Hayward, Liza Chasin, Le Carr&eacute; and
Morgan are exec producing. Hayward will shepherd the project for
Working Title.<br>

Oldman puts on his Smiley face</big></big><br>
(Daily Mail, June 3, 2010, by Baz Bamigboye)<br>
      <br>
Gary Oldman is in negotiations to play the &#8216;breathtakingly ordinary&#8217;
George Smiley, the anti-James Bond, in a bigscreen version of John Le
Carr&eacute;&#8217;s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Colin Firth, Michael
Fassbender and David Thewlis are in early discussions about playing
other vital roles in the film, about a Soviet mole at the heart of what
Le Carr&eacute; called the &#8216;Circus&#8217;&#8212;the secret intelligence service MI6.<br>
      <br>
Going for Oldman is a masterstroke of casting because he has one of
those deceptively ordinary yet shapeshifting faces that can be dressed
any which way. For the actor, it&#8217;s the role of a lifetime to play the
MI6 senior agent who has an air of awkwardness and a seemingly absurd
demeanour.<br>
      <br>
But those who have read Le Carr&eacute;&#8217;s Karla trilogy, or watched
Alec Guinness&#8217;s masterful portrait of Smiley in the 1979 television
series, or listened recently to Simon Russell Beale playing the role on
BBC radio, all know the Oxford graduate is nobody&#8217;s fool. Oldman, best
known recently for playing Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films and
Commissioner Gordon in Christopher Nolan&#8217;s Batman pictures, has met
Tomas Alfredson, who will direct from a screenplay by Peter Morgan,
writer of The Queen.<br>
      <br>
Alfredson made the Swedish vampire thriller Let The Right One In.
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is being made by Working Title and they
hope shooting will begin in London and other locations in September.<br>
      <br>
The key roles Alfredson and the folk at Working Title are focusing on
are for star names to play the various intelligence chiefs and
bureaucrats who are under suspicion of being a Soviet mole. Could it be
Percy Alleline, Roy Bland, Bill Haydon, Toby Esterhase or even Smiley
himself?<br>
      <br>
Other important parts still to be cast are Smiley&#8217;s faithless
aristocratic wife Lady Ann and Soviet expert Connie Sachs, played on
TV, respectively, by Sian Phillips and Beryl Reid.<br>
      <br>
The detail of the social, class and political layers of Britain were in
the seven-part BBC drama and, I&#8217;m told, those who have read Morgan&#8217;s
script have been equally impressed at how he has managed to put the
heart and essence of Le Carr&eacute;&#8217;s classic into the screenplay.<br>
